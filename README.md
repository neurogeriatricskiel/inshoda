# INertial Sensor HOme Data Analysis (INSHODA)

This repository was created to store documentation and signal processing pipelines to analyze the inertial sensor data that was collected in the home environment. It is a joint effort between the Universitaetsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein (UKSH) Kiel, Germany, and UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Brescia, Italy. Data was collected using inertial measurement units (IMUs) strapped to different body segments. 

In most setups, at least one sensor strapped to the low back and one sensor strapped to the lateral side just above the ankle joint were used.
